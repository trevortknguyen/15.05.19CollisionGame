Thai Nguyen's Contributions:
  My main contributions came from setting up the main window management system using the GLFW API. I also set up most of the OpenGL method calls using the LWJGL3 binding. Polymorphism of the squares were used so that if we were to add more polygon shapes, it would simplify the process. Also, the event callbacks utilized by GLFW were designed by me.
